PSY 1:1... In the beginning there was only darkness, and so He made light.
PSY 1:2... There was only light, and so He was lonely. He sculpted Necra. But she and He could not speak, so woven by she was language.
PSY 2:15... And in Psydonia he made man in His own image. And His partner would seed the land with those who would tend it.
PSY 8:3... They two, lives of bliss and peace. Their creations, content and devoted. And she in her divinity and mortality created Death through herself.
PSY 7:1... He mourned and dreaded until He could no longer. And so He tore from Himself a finger and thumb to sculpt a new form for her aimless soul.
PSY 9:7... Within His three-fingered hand, He held her painted skull, and she bid forth a world beyond. And she invited Him to see.
PSY 13:13... Deep beneath the crust, daemons and devils stirred. Psydon faced their armies, alone, His overwhelming holiness smiting the forces of hell.
PSY 15:1... Though striken He in His heart, mortally wounded, He bid His love to His people. And from His wound, carried by Necra's arms of bone, He expired by her hand.
PSY 20:5... Butcher she was, butcher she shall ever be. From His slain corpse, she fashioned His children. First Astrata and Noc, then followed the rest.
PSY 20:10... Whilst His children reign, He may not reform. Our faith is patience. Psydon will return one dae.
