<p><strong><em>Teatise on the Subjecte of Foge most un-naturale</em></strong></p>
<p>--------------------------------------</p>

None who visit Enigma may fail to notice the peculiar foge rising from the ground on some daes is quite different from the trusty olde foge from the sea.
</p><p><br></p><p>

After muche deliberation and experimentation, I have concluded that thr reason without doubt, lies in the cause of the different foges.
</p><p><br></p><p>

The sea-borne variant surely comes from some sort of emanation from Abyssor or its machinations, a simple mechanical effect of stirring the water with its great whale-body perhaps.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Meanwhile, having dug many pits in places where the more mystical foge emanates strongly from, I found naught but a few bones and dirt, no matter how deep I had my servants dig!
</p><p><br></p><p>

Having measured a depth of 24 fathoms at the deepest, and consulting the calculations of Petreus the Astrologer, nothing lies beneath this depth besides the realm of the Underworld, where Necra holds sway.
<br>
The exact depth is of course not knowne but mine own calculations put the Underworld at no less than 100 fathomes depth. Thus the strange fog that seeps into our very homes must be coming from that ghastly realm.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Perhaps prayers to Necra is the most expedient way to prevent it, meanwhile I will continue mine experiments into Necra-proof floor tiles.
