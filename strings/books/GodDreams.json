God of Dreams and Nitemares
&quot;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>

Asleep yet Awake, Awake yet Asleep. Both and Neither.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Lucid Dreams and Mind fog and Brain Fog upon those cursed or blessed leading to death or realization.
</p><p><br></p><p>

The god has no face yet like remembering a dream trying to recall how the god looked... like a endless mist of fog clouding the mind yet the wrath of such a god can depend on the stress of the dae and the nites frights, as sleep some wise men claims dreams are visions and nitemares dark omens.
</p><p><br></p><p>

But do you believe do you dream do you stir in your sleeping spot of fear in your mind or gaze silently into nothingness responding to nothing and even to death's embrace or awaken in lucidity and gain insight what has been occuring around you?
