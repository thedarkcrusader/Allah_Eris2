SOUPE OF CHOICE
&quot;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>

When famine strikes, a pot filled with water on a hearth will save your kin from Necras bony embrace!
</p><p><br></p><p>

Once the water boils, ye just need to add cheese wedges, fresh cheese, cackleberries, onions, potatoes, cabbage or turnips for a goode soupe. Let is rest, and more than three pieces is surely unneeded!
</p><p><br></p><p>

If ye have meats or truffles, tis a simple thing to make a stew with the same methode.
</p><p><br></p><p>

Oatmeal can be made as well, stout and bland, just lyke my trusty wife!
</p><p><br></p><p>

Beggars have been knowne to add dead rattus, raw spider meat and burned leftovers, and claim to be greatly refreshed, but tis not fit for common folk to eat. 
</p><p><br></p><p>

Foul Graggarites are said to make do with dung, rotten food, worms and living rattus, all manners of revolting thinges, their beastly patron letting them enjoy such things that would poison a sane man. 
</p><p><br></p><p>

Do use these secretes well and keep good folke from starving.
