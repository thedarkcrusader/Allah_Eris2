TO TILL THE SOIL
&quot;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>

Tilling the soil is best done with a hoe or a plough. Deeper furrows can be made by plowing twice, it shall makes your plot endure the test of time better. Dragging the plough along will do the worke, ride a creecher while doing it to save on sweat!

To feed the soil, ash and nitesoil are both useful, but compost from a bin, easily craftr, thats been filled with apple cores and sundry vegetables will last a longer time. Compost needs time to mull, use your hand or a shovel to turn it before it can be used.

Threshes can be made with some wood and a rope, and with some metal fittings turned to a deadly weapon. Take care to not thresh too big a pile of chaff at once or thy back may break from exhaustion.

Use of a pitchfork makes carrying wheat and oat stalks faster, tis also useful for seeing off beggars and goblins who maraud your fields!
