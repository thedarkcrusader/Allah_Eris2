		<h2> How to make a Grimoire </h2>
		[icon2html(new /obj/item/natural/hide, user)] You first need to start with some hide.<br>
		[icon2html(new /obj/item/paper/scroll, user)] Then you fill the bindings with scrolls until its full.<br>
		<br>
		[icon2html(new /obj/item/gem/violet, user)] Now here is where its most important. The gem you use determines how powerful your book is. <br>
		For instance arcyne melds are how you get the higher tiered books. Starting off however you can even use rocks that have magical powers in them. <br>
		Its recommened to use a low powered stone for your first tome as thats the easist material to get.

		<h2> Things to consider </h2>
		You can slot a gem into your spellbook and based on its arcyne power increase your study quality when you study with it.<br>
		You need to rest before you can study again this limits how fast you can grow. <br>
		Performing summoning rituals and finding magic materials is highly recommended to get the better griomires as they drastically increase your study quality. <br>
		Griomires do not store mana, when fighting it may be better to hold a foci or Primordial Crystal instead to have extra mana reserves. <br>
		Griomires are bound to their creators, the creator can hit someone with the grimoire will allow them to study with it. <br>
